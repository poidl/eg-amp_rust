This refers to commit a0340ffdcbb744c99a7a5323028daee0918c5cbf.
The objective is to make the Rust version equivalent to the C version. Running  the C and version a0340ffdcbb74 of the Rust version of the plugin with jalv:

valgrind --leak-check=yes --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all jalv http://example.org/eg-amp_rust (or http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp)

produces similar output. Difference is:
Rust (<) vs C (>):

<    total heap usage: 23,193 allocs, 23,184 frees, 2,836,163 bytes allocated
---
>    total heap usage: 23,313 allocs, 23,304 frees, 2,840,073 bytes allocated

I don't know what that means. Maybe the difference results just from the different uri strings?
